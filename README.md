# Mobile git notes

I've been journaling in a private repo, in markdown files, use a pre-commit hook that encrypts notes using a private GPG key. This workflow is very basic but works well on a machine. Sometimes, however, I have ideas on the road that I want to commit to my journal, but the only device in reach is my mobile device. For this reason I thought it'd be fun to have a mobile app with a Git(hub|lab)|Bitbucket integration and a markdown editor, so you can commit ideas from anywhere, in a safe and private way.
